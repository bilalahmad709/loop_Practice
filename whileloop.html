    <h2> loop</h2>
    <p> In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of
         instruction s that is continually repeated until
          a certain condition is reached. Typically, a 
          certain process is done, such as getting an
           item of data and changing it, and then some
            condition is checked such as whether a counter
             has reached a prescribed number.</p> <br>

             <h4>==>  loop is divided into three parts</h4>
             <h5> * Initialization </h5>
             <h5> * condition </h5>
             <h5> * incrrement / decrement </h5>

             <h2>while loop</h2>
             <p>A "While" Loop is used to repeat a 
                specific block of code an unknown number
                 of times, until a condition is met. For
                  example, if we want to ask a user for a
                   number between 1 and 10, we don't know
                    how many times the user may enter a 
                    larger number, so we keep asking 
                    "while the number is not between 1
                     and 10". </p>  <br>
                     
            <script>
                var a=1;
                while(a<=10){
                    document.write(a+":" + " "+" you are great boy <br>");
                    a=a+1;
                }

            </script>
